# 🌾 **WHEAT DATA TESTING GUIDE**

## **Current Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING**

I've created comprehensive wheat data for testing all dashboard features. The wheat data includes:

### **📊 Data Coverage:**
- **150+ data fields** covering all aspects of wheat cultivation
- **8 detailed varieties** with specific characteristics
- **7 major pests** with control methods
- **8 major diseases** with prevention strategies
- **Complete nutritional profile** with vitamins and minerals
- **Economic data** including yields, prices, and costs
- **Climate and soil requirements** for different regions

## **🧪 How to Test Wheat Data:**

### **1. Database Integration (Optional)**
If you want to test with real database data:
```bash
# Run the SQL script to populate database
psql -h your-supabase-host -U your-username -d your-database -f test-wheat-data.sql
```

### **2. Frontend Testing (Recommended)**
The comprehensive wheat data is already available in:
- `src/data/comprehensiveWheatData.ts` - Complete wheat object
- `src/data/cropData.ts` - Existing wheat data (already comprehensive)

## **🎯 Specific Wheat Testing Scenarios:**

### **Test 1: Wheat Search & Display**
1. **Open dashboard**: http://localhost:8080
2. **Search for "wheat"** in the search bar
3. **Verify wheat appears** in search results
4. **Check wheat card** displays correctly with:
   - Beautiful gradient design
   - Priority badge (High)
   - Status badges (GI Status, Smart Tech)
   - Quick metrics (Yield: 32 q/ha, Duration: 120-150 days)

### **Test 2: Wheat Card Details**
1. **Click on wheat card**
2. **Verify expandable details** work
3. **Check all 4 tabs**:
   - **Overview**: Basic info, climate, soil
   - **Agronomy**: Growing practices, pests, diseases
   - **Nutrition**: Calories, protein, vitamins, minerals
   - **Market**: Economics, varieties, export potential

### **Test 3: Wheat in Insights Dashboard**
1. **Click "Show Insights" button**
2. **Verify wheat contributes to metrics**:

   - Priority Crops percentage
   - GI Status crops
   - Smart Tech integration
3. **Check charts** show wheat data distribution

### **Test 4: Wheat in Comparison Tool**
1. **Click "Compare Crops" button**
2. **Add wheat to comparison**
3. **Compare wheat with other crops**
4. **Verify all wheat data fields** display in comparison table

### **Test 5: Wheat in Advanced Filters**
1. **Click "Show Filters" button**
2. **Apply wheat-specific filters**:
   - Season: "Rabi"
   - Climate: "Temperate"
   - Water: "Medium to High"
