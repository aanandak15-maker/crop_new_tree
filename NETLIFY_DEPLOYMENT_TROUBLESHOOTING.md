# Netlify Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "InitializingFailedBuildingCompleteDeployingSkippedCleanupSkippedPost-processingSkipped"

This error indicates that while the build completes successfully, the deployment step is being skipped, which usually means there's an issue with the build output or configuration.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Enhanced Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)
- Updated Node version to 20 (from 18)
- Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag for npm compatibility
- Increased memory allocation with `NODE_OPTIONS`
- Added explicit processing configurations
- Enhanced caching headers

### 2. Build Script Optimization
- Added `build:netlify` script for production builds
- Used `npm ci --prefer-offline` for faster, more reliable installs
- Added build verification script

### 3. Vite Configuration Improvements
- Added proper asset handling for Netlify
- Disabled compressed size reporting for faster builds
- Added commonjs options for better compatibility

## Common Causes & Additional Solutions

### A. Build Timeout Issues
If builds are taking too long:
```bash
# In netlify.toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"
```

### B. Dependency Issues
If npm install fails:
```bash
# Use legacy peer deps
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
```

### C. Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are set in Netlify dashboard:
- Go to Site Settings > Environment Variables
- Add any `VITE_*` variables your app needs

### D. Build Cache Issues
Clear Netlify build cache:
- Go to Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Clear cache and deploy site

### E. Node Version Mismatch
Ensure `.nvmrc` file exists and specifies Node 20:
```
20
```

## Manual Build Verification

Run the verification script locally to ensure builds work:
```bash
./build-verify.sh
```

## Netlify Dashboard Checks

1. **Build Logs**: Check for specific error messages
2. **Deploy Settings**: Verify publish directory is `dist`
3. **Build Commands**: Ensure command matches `netlify.toml`
4. **Environment Variables**: Check for missing variables
5. **Build Timeout**: Ensure build completes within limits

## Alternative Build Commands

If issues persist, try these alternative build commands in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
# Option 1: Simple build
command = "npm run build"

# Option 2: With cache clearing
command = "rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install && npm run build"

# Option 3: Using yarn
command = "yarn install && yarn build"
```

## Contact Netlify Support

If all solutions fail:
1. Check Netlify status page
2. Review build logs thoroughly
3. Contact Netlify support with build logs and configuration
4. Provide minimal reproduction case

## Prevention

- Test builds locally before pushing
- Use consistent Node/npm versions
- Monitor build times and optimize if needed
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use build caching effectively
